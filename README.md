## ⚡ What Makes It Different

Most tools in this space are built on general models. Forbidden Vision ships three models 
trained from scratch on hand-curated data, built specifically for these tasks:

1. **Detection & Segmentation** — consistent across real, anime, and NSFW; handles extreme poses and heavy occlusion  
2. **Neural Corrector** — analyzes and fixes exposure, black levels, and color automatically.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install** via ComfyUI Manager (search "Forbidden Vision") or [manually](#️-installation)
2. **Load the example workflow** from `src/workflows/forbidden_vision_complete.json`
3. **Enable groups one at a time** using the Fast Group Bypasser:
   - Start with just **Builder** enabled to find your composition
   - Add **Refiner** to enhance colors and lighting
   - Enable **Second Pass** for detail refinement
   - Turn on **Face Fix** if needed
4. **Adjust and iterate** - tweak settings in each node as you refine

> **Models download automatically** on first run from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/luxdelux7/ForbiddenVision_Models). This may take a minute.

  </p>
</div>


## ✨ What's Included

### Core Suite
* **Fixer** – Face detection, restoration, and context-aware inpainting
* **Refiner** – Automatic enhancement with tone correction, upscaling, and effects
* **Builder** – First-pass sampling with adaptive CFG and self-correction

### Versatile Tools
* **Inpainter** – The Fixer's blending engine in a manual inpainting node
* **Rebuilder** – Basic ksampler with integrated VAE decoding
* **Fixer Mask** – Outputs masks from the detection models
* **Settings** – Simple output for samplers/schedulers

## 🎭 Fixer Node

The Fixer node replaces complex face restoration workflows with a single, reliable node solution. Using 2 custom trained models for detection and mask segmentation you get consistent results with fast performance. Works with both realistic and anime styles for any level of face modification.

> **Note:** While the detection and segmentation models are trained on thousands of images, edge cases and failures can still occur—especially with extreme stylization, heavy occlusion, or unusual compositions.
If you encounter detection failures, report them via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/luxdelux7/ComfyUI-Forbidden-Vision/issues). For NSFW images, upload to an external host (Catbox.moe, ImgBB, etc.) and share the link in your issue.

<img src="./images/masks.webp" alt="Mask Example" style="border-radius: 6px; box-shadow: 0 0 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
<p><em>Forbidden Vision segmentation model takes into account face masks, stylistic eyebrows, eyelashes etc. so the inpainting isn't limited</em></p>
</div>

**Key Features:**

* **Face Detection and Masking**: Custom trained YOLO11 and segmentation models optimized for mixed-domain content
* **NSFW friendly**: Works reliably on all adult content without filtering or judgement.
* **Detail aware segmentation**: Detects eyebrows, eyelashes, sunglasses etc. within the face to ensure best inpainting results
* **Context-Aware Inpainting**: Crops detected faces, processes them at optimal resolution, and uses conditioned inpainting together with built in differential diffusion to match the original image's lighting and style.
* **Flexible Prompt Control**: Add details to existing prompts, replace prompts entirely, or exclude specific tags just for face processing.
* **AI Pre-Upscaling**: Upscale small faces with AI models before processing for better detail in the final result.
* **Smart Blending**: Applies automatic color correction and feathered mask blending for seamless integration with the original image

<p><em>Original (left), then with 0.3 denoise (middle) and with appended prompt at 0.7 denoise (right)</em></p>
</div>

### 🔮 Refiner Node

The Refiner automatically fixes common image problems: flat lighting, washed out colors, weak contrast—without manual tweaking. A trained model analyzes your image and applies the right corrections, plus optional AI upscaling and depth of field effects.

> **Tip:** Works great as a pre-pass before your second sampling stage for cleaner, more polished results.  
> Also perfect as a standalone one-click enhancer.

<summary><strong>📦 [ Upscale Models ]</strong></summary>

Use any upscale model you prefer, however for both speed and quality I found [Phhofm models](https://github.com/Phhofm/models) to be great, specifically:

**For Fixer:**
- [4xBHI_realplksr_dysample_real](https://github.com/Phhofm/models/releases/download/4xbhi_realplksr/4xBHI_realplksr_dysample_real.pth)

**For Builder:**
- [2xBHI_small_realplksr_small_pretrain](https://github.com/Phhofm/models/releases/download/2xBHI_small_realplksr_small_pretrain/2xBHI_small_realplksr_small_pretrain.pth)

Generally, for faces you want a 4x model, and for the refiner (if using before second pass sampling) you want around 2x for speed, but feel free to use what you prefer.

### Core Sampling

- The sampling options are the same as the core ksampler. I set **euler_ancestral** with **sgm_uniform** as default as that is usually what I use with most SDXL based models.
- For general fixing **denoise_strength** of between 0.2 - 0.4 at even **8 steps** will usually give decent results but I prefer to go higer
- With low denoise **CFG** doesn't impact the generation that much, but keep it moderate to be on the safe side -> default of 3 is good.
- If you want bigger changes, the node will do well even up to **0.9** denoise (depending on image) however for such cases you'll probably want to modify the prompts and maybe use a different scheduler like beta

### Face Selection & Processing

**face_selection**  
0 = process all detected faces. Set 1 or higher to target a specific detected face in order (e.g., the closest face or the one you want edited).

**detection_confidence**  
YOLO’s confidence threshold for face detection. 0.75 works for about 90% of images. Strong detections typically fall between 0.86–0.90+. Lower only if your image has extreme stylization or very small faces.

**manual_rotation**  
Useful for images where faces appear at unusual angles (including upside-down). The node rotates the face for optimal processing and automatically rotates it back during blending.

**processing_resolution**  
The 1:1 square resolution used for cropping the detected face during sampling (default: 1024). Adjust based on the resolution sweet-spot of your model. Higher = more detail, but also more VRAM and time.

**enable_pre_upscale**  
Pre-upscales the cropped face region before feeding it into sampling. This improves detail restoration on low-resolution faces. Enabled by default and recommended for most workflows.

**upscaler_model**  
Choose between Bicubic/Lanczos (fast Python scaling) or an AI upscaler (recommended: 4×). AI models give sharper and more stable facial details.

**crop_padding**  
Determines how much surrounding context is included around the face (default: 1.6). More padding = better inpainting consistency, since the model sees more of the original image’s lighting and style.

---

### Prompting  
**CLIP input must be connected for these options to work.**

**face_positive_prompt / face_negative_prompt**  
Tags added here are prepended to the connected conditioning. Great for adding or guiding face details without altering the global prompt.

**replace toggles**  
Instead of adding tags, these toggles completely replace the connected conditioning for the face sample. Useful when you want full control over the facial generation prompt.

**exclusions**  
Removes specific tags from the positive conditioning. Ideal for removing unwanted traits (e.g., “smile”, “angry”, “glasses”) while keeping the rest of your prompt intact.

---

### Blending & Masking

**blend_softness**  
Applies subtle feathering to the blended region, improving the transition between the generated face and the original background.

**mask_expansion**  
Uniformly expands the segmentation mask by a set number of pixels (default: 2). Helps avoid harsh transitions by including slightly more skin and edge detail.

**sampling_mask_blur_size**  
The radius of the blur applied to mask edges (default: 21). Larger values create a wider falloff area around the mask border.

**sampling_mask_blur_strength**  
Determines how strongly the blur is applied (default: 1.0). Higher values further soften the mask edge for more natural blending.

---

### Major Toggles

**enable_color_correction**  
Analyzes the entire image’s tone and lighting, then adjusts the newly sampled face to match it. 

**enable_lightness_rescue**  
Analyzes the face ligthness compared to the original. If its darker by 5% or  more, it brings it closer to the original, then runs a 0.05 denoise sampling pass to cleanup any artifacts. Useful mostly for higher denoise as that can drastically change face brigthness in certain images.

**enable_segmentation**  
Uses the segmentation model to generate a detailed mask (including eyebrows, eyelashes, facial hair, sunglasses, etc.). When off, falls back to a simple oval mask based on YOLO’s bounding box.

**enable_differential_diffusion**  
Uses integrated differential diffusion for smoother, more coherent inpainting. Recommended in almost all cases for the most natural results.

### Upscaling

**enable_upscale**  
Enables optional AI or bicubic upscaling after tone/color/detail processing. Useful before a second sampling pass or as a final enhancement step.

**upscale_model**  
Select which upscaler to load. Models are auto-detected from your ComfyUI upscale_models folder. 

**upscale_factor**  
By how much an image should be upscaled. I personally prefer 1.2 before a second diffusion pass.

---

### Neural Corrector Controls

**neural_corrector**  
Adjusts exposure, black levels, shadows, and overall tone and colors using a custom trained model.

**corrector_tone and corrector_color**  
Blends between original and fully auto-toned output.  
- Default is full power for tone and 70% for color.
- If you find the image too bright in places or too dark, simply lower the tone strength. 
- If you find the color shift, the image "temperature" not to your liking, lower the color strength.

---

### AI Relighting
>uses Depth Anything v2 depth estimation model

**ai_relight**  
Gently brightens important foreground subjects using depth information.
Useful for lifting faces, characters, or the main subject without flattening shadows.

**ai_relight_strength**  
Controls how bright the relighting effect is.
Higher = more subject emphasis.

---

### AI Depth of Field
>uses Depth Anything v2 depth estimation model

**ai_enable_dof**  
Simulates depth of field using an estimated depth map. Foreground and background are blurred based on distance from a computed focus plane.

**ai_dof_strength**  
Controls the blur intensity. Higher values widen bokeh and separation.

**ai_dof_focus_depth**  
Determines where the virtual focus plane sits (0.50–0.99). Lower = closer focus, higher = deeper focus.

**ai_depth_model**  
Choose the depth model used for depth inference.  
- **V2-Small** — faster, less VRAM  
- **V2-Base** — more accurate and stable depth

---

### Tiled VAE Encoding

**use_tiled_vae**  
When re-encoding the final image into a latent, uses tiled VAE encoding to prevent seams and reduce VRAM load. Useful for high-resolution refinement.

**tile_size**  
Size of each tile during VAE encoding. Larger tiles = faster but more VRAM; smaller tiles = safer for low VRAM systems.

---

### Input / Output Behavior

**latent** *(optional)*  
Latent input for refinement. If provided, Refiner decodes it (with caching) and processes the result.

**image** *(optional)*  
Direct image input. Skips decoding if latent isn’t provided.

**vae** *(optional)*  
Used to re-encode the processed image back into latent form. Required when you want to feed the refined output into another diffusion step.

### Core Sampling and inputs

**self_correction**  
Performs a 0.05 denoise, 2-step polishing pass at the end of sampling. This corrects small inconsistencies, stabilizes shapes, and reduces overcooked artifacts. Recommended ON for most workflows.

**vae** *(optional)*  
If connected, the Builder decodes the final latent to an image preview. If not, output preview is a blank placeholder but the latent remains valid.

>The sampling options are the same as the core ksampler. I set **euler_ancestral** with **sgm_uniform** as default as that is usually what I use with most SDXL based models.

---

### Resolution & Batch

**resolution_preset**  
Choose from a set of pre-defined “ideal” SDXL/SD1.5 aspect-ratio presets. When set to **Custom**, width/height use the fields below.

**custom_width**  
Manual width when using “Custom” mode. Must be divisible by 64, since SD latent resolution = image/8.

**custom_height**  
Same as above but for height.
